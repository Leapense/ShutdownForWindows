## What app can do?
-----
Lock/Signout/Switch user/Logout/Task manager
It's same with Ctrl+alt+del method.

## Why?
-----
If you don't know keymapping thing, you feels
like confused. So I made one simple click power menu
(**And Fixing The Windows Inconstancy Problem**)

## Is there bugs?
-----
You can send the feedback. :)
